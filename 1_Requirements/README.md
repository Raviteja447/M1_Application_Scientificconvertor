# Introduction

## Unit Convertor

Conversion of units is the conversion between different units of measurement for the same quantity, typically through multiplicative conversion factors.

##  Conversion Factor
  The process of conversion depends on the specific situation and the intended purpose. This may be governed by regulation, contract, technical specifications or other published standards. Engineering judgment may include such factors as
  - The intended use of the measurement including the engineering tolerances.
  - Historical definitions of the units and their derivatives used in old measurements; e.g., international foot vs. US survey foot. 
  - The precision and accuracy of measurement and the associated uncertainty of measurement.
  - The statistical confidence interval or tolerance interval of the initial measurement.
   - The number of significant figures of the measurement.

 ##  Who
      unit converters are used by those who require quantities in desired form of units for analysis of a system and is commonly used by students,engineers and many more.
      
 ##  What
      Unit Convertor makes conversion between different units of measurements for the same quantity.
    
 ##  When
       When using measuring quantities,beacuse units allow people to communicate amounts uniformly in a way that can be understood by others.
     
 ##  Why
       Because conversions are such an important part of problems,and you have to keep track of them so carefully,there's a systematic way of handling conversions.
       
  ##  How
       Through multiplicative conversion factors.A conversion factor is used to change the units of a measured quantity without changing its value.
